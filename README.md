This is the monolitchic backend version of the project. The entire e-commerce project will cover complete e-commerce operations, including buyers, sellers, payment, shipping providers and logging.

Currently available projects are:<br/>

[E-Commerce Frontend Web](https://github.com/cemalaydeniz/ecommerce.Web) (Angular and Bootstrap)<br/>
[E-Commerce Frontend Admin Console](https://github.com/cemalaydeniz/ecommerce.Admin) (Angular and Angular Material)<br/>

## To-Do List
These are the features I am planning to add/implement/create. The entries in the to-do list have no priorities over each other and they might be added out of order.

- Completing the web frontend for buyers and sellers with Angular and Bootstrap (no-standalone)
- Completing the web frontend for an admin console with Angular and Angular Material (standalone)
- Creating a microservice version of the backend (probably for Azure)
- Creating a mobile application for both web frontend and shipping providers with React Native 
- Creating a mobile application for shipping providers to scan QR codes to complete orders
- AI assistant that helps users with questions related to the system
- AI suggestions for buyers depending on their purchase histories, special dates etc.
